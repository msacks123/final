# Final CS project


My project is really bad mainly due to time mismanagement.

However, I technically do have a project that exists, and at least I was able to work with HTML, which I haven't used since eigth grade.

My data was taken from [here](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&recipient_committee_type=P&min_amount=2700&max_amount=2700) and [here](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?two_year_transaction_period=2020&recipient_committee_type=P&min_amount=2800&max_amount=2800). This is the same as the example project, I just wanted to *try* to wrangle it myself.
