<h1 style="font-size:300%;">CS 241 final project</h1>
<p>This project is bad, as I had quite a hard time getting the data into a proper data structure, as well as wrangling the data in pandas.</p>
<p>However, I did create a data visualization:</p>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<p>I downloaded the data, read it into pandas, and trimmed it so that only contained the columns that I cared about.</p>
<p>Then, I joined the two datasets and made a plot. That's the plot above.</p>
<p>However, this plot is just a plot of the variation between the 2016 and 2020 candidates, represented by their committee name. It doesn't help understand the dataset at all. That's also why the axes are so squished, as there are far too many committees to represent all at once in a clean fashion.</p>
